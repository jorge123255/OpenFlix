**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

## Introduction

OpenFlix ("we", "our", or "the app") is an open-source media streaming application that allows you to access and stream content from your self-hosted OpenFlix Media Server. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Usage Information
The app stores locally on your device:

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information solely to:

- Track watch progress for resume functionality

## Data Storage and Security

- **Authentication tokens** are stored securely on your device using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms

## Data Sharing

We do not:
- Sell your personal information
- Share your information with third parties for marketing purposes
