## Development

### Code Quality

Before submitting changes, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Format code (including generated files)
dart format .

# Analyze code for issues
flutter analyze

# Run tests (if available)
flutter test
```

**Note**: CI checks exclude generated files (`.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`) from formatting and analysis checks. You can run `dart format .` locally to format everything, but only your hand-written code will be validated in CI.

These checks are automatically run in CI for all pull requests.

### Code Generation

The project uses code generation for JSON serialization. After modifying model classes, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Building for Production

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```
